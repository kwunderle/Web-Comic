		<h2>Who made this?</h2>
		<p>Hello and welcome to my bio page! I am a 33-year-old artist and designer who has dabbled in many different facets of the arts and crafts world. My biggest passions are cartoons and comics and they have always been my favorite thing to draw. When Iâ€™m not drawing or consuming mass amounts of various media, I enjoy making costumes and props and entering them in craftsmanship competitions at pop culture conventions in my area. Webcomics and Flash Games (RIP) have been an influential part of my life for a long time, and it was really awesome to bring something like this to life.</p>
		<p>One of my favorite things about the 90's was all the different kinds of animated films that had different levels of humor to be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. It's interesting to rewatch things from the past and find that some of them are rather dark or even inappropriate in ways we never noticed. You catch all the tidbits that flew over your head when you were younger. These movies inspired me to draw as a kid and create the world the way that I want to see it.</p>
